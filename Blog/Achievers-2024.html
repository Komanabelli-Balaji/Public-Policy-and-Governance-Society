                <h2>Question:
                </h2>
                <p>What non-academic activities or hobbies did you engage in during your preparation, and how do you think they contributed to your success?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Shivam Kumar:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">While working in the private sector, I prepared for UPSC alongside my job. My hobby of running helped maintain my mental health by providing necessary breaks from studying. Although I did not engage in specific non-academic activities for preparation, such hobbies are essential for mental and physical well-being. Everyone should dedicate 30-40 minutes daily to a hobby.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Abhay Daga:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">While preparing for the civil services exam, I engaged in two key activities to maintain my mental and physical stamina. I worked out at least four days a week to boost my endorphins and stamina. Additionally, I explored spiritual texts, which helped me focus on the process rather than the results, embodying the concept of Nishkama karma.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Sanjay Yadav:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Having a true hobby is crucial during UPSC preparation. My passion for cricket, especially test matches, provides a refreshing break and joy amid the rigorous study schedule. Engaging in a hobby not only offers relaxation but also imparts valuable lessons. Additionally, maintaining a circle of non-academic, supportive friends helps keep a balanced mindset. Regular workouts boost physical stamina, while exploring spiritual texts keeps me focused on the process, not just the results. Hobbies enhance personality, making the preparation journey more enjoyable and sustainable.
                </p>


                <h2>Question:
                </h2>
                <p>Were there any hobbies that you pursued during the campus or if you have started your preparation while staying in the campus, were there any extra academic activities that you were engaged into?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Shivam Kumar:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Participating in extracurricular activities during college, like hockey and various events, significantly shaped my personality, indirectly aiding my UPSC prelims and mains preparation, and directly benefiting my interview performance. These activities were highlighted in my application form, leading to relevant questions during the interview. Extracurriculars help at various stages of the journey, not just in boosting marks but in developing a well-rounded personality, essential for the UPSC process.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Abhay Daga:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Like Shivam, I decided to prepare for civil services during the third year of my job. While at KGP, I was not focused on UPSC but was deeply involved in dramatics, pouring my heart into every play. Interestingly, this became a key discussion point in my personality test. I also engaged in cricket, both activities contributing to my prep and interview success. You never know which passions will positively impact your journey.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Sanjay Yadav:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Engaging in extracurricular activities and leadership roles at IIT Kharagpur not only enriches your practical knowledge but also boosts your CV, akin to corporate expectations. These experiences fill essential sections in your application, making you well-prepared for interview questions. Immersing yourself in one or two activities can evolve into fulfilling hobbies, providing unique insights and ensuring you're never caught off guard. This proactive involvement transforms your journey, adding depth and distinction to your profile.
                </p>


                <h2>Question:
                </h2>
                <p>How did you approach the optional subject selection for the UPSC CSE exam?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Shivam Kumar:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">I chose mathematics as my optional because of my strong college performance and clear interest. For selecting your optional, prioritize genuine interest over strategic advantages like GS correlations or scoring trends. Many engineers diversify their options, choosing subjects like anthropology, sociology, or core engineering topics, so explore the syllabus and choose what excites you. Choose your optional based on genuine interest, not current trends. Commit to it for the long haul, as the journey to success in UPSC can vary widely in duration.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Abhay Daga:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Coming from a computer science background, I did not have direct options in the exam, so I chose mathematics based on key factors. First, its enduring interest for sustained effort. Second, its objective nature ensures correct answers earn marks without examiner bias. Unlike humanities, where interpretation can be risky. Third, technical subjects like math avoid extensive answer writing and direct competition since they're less common options. This strategic choice prioritized clarity and objectivity in my preparation approach.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Sanjay Yadav:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">When deciding between technical and non-technical optional subjects for UPSC, it's a balance of benefits. Technical subjects offer clear, objective scoring with dedicated effort. Non-technical options, like GS-based subjects, allow more time for broader studies. Your choice should reflect personal interest and alignment with your college background. Whether you choose based on topper trends or new interests, it's about finding what suits your strengths and study strategy best.
                </p>

                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Prioritize class attendance for strong academic performance in campus life, ensuring a solid CGPA. Depending on your UPSC timeline immediately after graduation or later balance studies with extracurriculars and interests. This approach allows flexibility and preparation readiness as per your chosen timeline.

                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">For those pursuing civil services immediately after graduation, balancing social life is crucial. While prioritizing exam preparation, reducing social time can help maintain focus. It's about striking a balance—neither neglecting studies nor isolating oneself entirely. Social interactions also offer networking opportunities and diverse perspectives, contributing positively to preparation.

                <h2>Question:
                </h2>
                <p>How did you balance your UPSC preparation with other commitments or responsibilities?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Shivam Kumar:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Balancing a full-time job and civil services preparation required meticulous planning. I structured my day to include reading newspapers during office breaks and revision during lunch. Post-work hours were dedicated entirely to study, totaling about five to six focused hours daily. Weekends became invaluable for extended study sessions, where I minimized social activities to achieve up to 10 hours of preparation each day. This disciplined approach ensured I could manage both responsibilities effectively.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Abhay Daga:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Having quit my job in june 2021, i dedicated myself full-time to upsc preparation, unencumbered by financial obligations at home. My commitment was clear: aside from family emergencies, my sole focus was on studying. I adopted a structured approach, treating myself as both employer and employee, ensuring accountability in my daily progress. This balance, supported by minimal social interactions, streamlined my preparation journey effectively.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Sanjay Yadav:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">In my UPSC preparation strategy, discipline is paramount. I prioritize minimizing distractions, using breaks effectively for study, and dedicating weekends to intensive preparation. As exams approach, my focus remains solely on studying to ensure I'm fully prepared and performing at my best.
                </p>



                <h2>Question:
                </h2>
                <p>Did you follow a specific study plan or did you customize your preparation according to your strengths and weakness?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Shivam Kumar:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">In UPSC preparation, there's no one-size-fits-all strategy. I focused on prelims first due to time constraints and leveraged my strength in grasping concepts quickly. Addressing weaknesses like answer writing required practice. For newcomers, explore strategies, adapt weekly, and prioritize flexibility and self-awareness for success.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Abhay Daga:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Understand your daily rhythms for effective study sessions. Customize your approach: tackle tough topics when most productive, and easier ones during low-energy times. Long-term, adapt to weaknesses; I focused intensely on math post-mains. Early prep is for experimenting and refining what works, avoiding last-minute changes before exams.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Sanjay Yadav:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Customize your study schedule to suit your strengths and weaknesses. Experiment with combining optional and GS daily or splitting them by day to find what works best for you. Adapt based on continuous assessment for optimal preparation.
                </p>



                <h2>Question:
                </h2>
                <p>What was the most challenging aspect of preparing for UPSC, and how did you overcome it?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Shivam Kumar:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">The challenging phase can vary from person to person, depending on their performance at different stages. Each stage has distinct requirements, and everyone's mental state is unique, so it largely depends on individual performance. This process demands significant mental strength. Transitioning between professional work and being an aspirant was particularly difficult for me. It often left me feeling so exhausted that I would skip studying for the day, which was very challenging.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Abhay Daga:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">The challenges in an exam vary by individual stages. Personally, I find the mains particularly demanding. While prelims test mental stamina through extensive practice and recall, the mains involve physical exertion, requiring six hours of writing daily over five days. This is extremely exhausting, necessitating both physical endurance and mental focus. Mastering answer writing is a steep learning curve, requiring immense patience and perseverance throughout the process.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Sanjay Yadav:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">In my first three attempts, I couldn't clear the prelims, which became my biggest fear. However, I didn't lose hope and kept trying, and eventually, I succeeded. This process varies from person to person, but self-doubt is inevitable. You may score low on tests despite your hard work, which can be disheartening. UPSC continuously tests your mental strength and patience. Once you master these aspects, the journey becomes smoother. Despite the ups and downs, maintaining patience and perseverance is crucial.
                </p>


                <h2>Question:
                </h2>
                <p>Can you share a particular memorable or unexpected question you encountered during the interview process?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Shivam Kumar:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">History was a challenging subject for me, particularly memorizing dates and names. I struggled significantly with human geography, where recalling numerous names and maps was necessary. In an exam, you can't neglect any subject, as each plays a crucial role. Previous year questions helped me prioritize different areas within a subject, allowing me to focus on key topics. This approach enabled me to conquer history as well. Prioritization is essential, especially in subjects with technical aspects.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Abhay Daga:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">In the prelims, geography can be challenging due to the complex language of the highly informative NCERT books. For those with math as an optional subject, many struggle with physics topics like fluid mechanics, which are initially hard to grasp. The questions are typically fixed and sourced from standard books. By understanding how questions are framed, you can turn your weaknesses into strengths, benefiting various aspects of the exam.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Sanjay Yadav:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">For me, memorizing facts is one of the biggest challenges. In GS1, modern and medieval history were particularly difficult, but overall, learning these subjects was quite enjoyable.
                </p>


                <h2>Question:
                </h2>
                <p>It is wiser to appear for UPSC just after the graduation, leaving placements or one should secure a job and have some experience to get some sense of security and they appear for exam?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Shivam Kumar:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">There are all kinds of people: those who clear the exam while working, those who quit their jobs to prepare, and those who clear it successfully. Depending on your priorities, decide what you want to do in life. If you are certain that UPSC is your goal, you can attempt it right after college preparation. If you're undecided, gaining experience in any sector can still benefit you in the future. Don't follow what others are doing; this is your journey. Make decisions based on your life needs and career priorities.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Abhay Daga:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Having some work experience is always beneficial, given the extremely high failure rate of this exam. Even if you give your best efforts, there’s a chance you may not clear it. Graduating with some work experience offers two advantages: you can fully commit to UPSC preparation, and if you don't succeed, you can return to a corporate job. Additionally, if you enter the bureaucracy and find it’s not what you expected, you have a benchmark for comparison, having experienced both corporate and bureaucratic life. This positions you better to make informed decisions.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Sanjay Yadav:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">It totally depends on the aspirant's ability to manage themselves and how much hardship they can endure.
                </p>



                <h2>Question:
                </h2>
                <p>During the interview, what qualities did you feel a candidate should have developed during their college years?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Shivam Kumar:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">If you look at the UPSC interview, it has a specified syllabus, but many people are unaware of it. The notification clearly mentions the qualities they seek in a candidate, such as mental alertness, awareness of current affairs, and the ability to assimilate thoughts. Developing these qualities is crucial for the interview stage, as it enhances overall personality. Engaging in public speaking, participating in extracurricular activities, taking leadership roles in college, and cultivating reading habits are all ways to strengthen yourself mentally and prepare for challenges.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Abhay Daga:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">College provides a great opportunity to develop patience and perseverance. With numerous inter-hall competitions and the annual open IIT competition, you get a clear idea of what healthy competition entails. It's a win-win situation, not just for acquiring skills but also for the depth of content that will likely be questioned in your personality test.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Sanjay Yadav:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">College provides numerous opportunities. While having knowledge is important, how you deliver it is crucial. College provides a platform where you can engage in various activities, shaping your personality. Involvement in such activities will undoubtedly help you in the long run to shape your personality.
                </p>


                <h2>Question:
                </h2>
                <p>Balancing the demand of placement interviews with your UPSC preparation must have been challenging, can you share your approach to managing both effectively.</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Shivam Kumar:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">For those appearing for UPSC right after placement season or graduation, prioritizing UPSC preparation over placement is essential because they have committed to the examination. However, if one is not very serious about UPSC, opting for the corporate sector is wise since college placements offer a golden opportunity that may not come again. The campus recruitment process is unique, with companies coming directly to hire you.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Abhay Daga:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">I haven't faced such a situation myself. During placement season, it's crucial to prepare 2-3 months in advance because this is a unique time when companies come to your college to recruit you, whereas normally you would have to go to them for a job. Therefore, seize the opportunity and join the corporate sector, and you can pursue your UPSC preparation later.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Sanjay Yadav:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">This entirely depends on the individual. If one intends to attempt UPSC right after college, they should fully dedicate their final year to preparation. Conversely, if someone plans to make a serious attempt the following year, they should focus more on placements now.
                </p>
