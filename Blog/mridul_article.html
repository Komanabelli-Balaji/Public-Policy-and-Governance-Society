                    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                    <p>The visible signs of social disorganization reflect some underlying problems that lead
                        to increased crimes. The origin of the broken-window theory is associated with a 1982
                        Atlantic Monthly article by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling. The theory is known
                        to suggest that broken windows in society are often synonymous with apparent signs of
                        disorder and can lead to increased crime rates if left unaddressed. This theory states that
                        a simple and prompt focus on minor offenses on time can prevent big criminalities in
                        the future. Creating safer neighbourhoods is a concern in today’s 21st century as it was
                        back in the mid-1970s when the state of New Jersey announced a “Safe and Clean
                        Neighbourhoods Program”, which aimed at improving the quality of Community life
                        . Policing Strategies informed by this
                        theory often emphasize the significance of maintaining order through community
                        engagement and proactive measures. People in Kharagpur belong to different religions
                        and castes and are thus known for their ethnic and linguistic diversity. These aspects
                        often lead to social segregation more than inclusion in society.
                        Hence, the secluded areas of Kharagpur with social diversity but an immiscible cultural
                        difference creates the idea of broken windows where serious street crimes can flourish
                        in areas if disorderly behaviour goes unchecked.<br><br>
                    </p>


                    <h2>Background on Broken Windows Policing:</h2>
                        The nature of the broken window theory is a perception-based analysis of a societal
                        problem. The external environment and crimes are sometimes not always
                        correlated. However, much evidence exists that these are still closely related. It was
                        pointed out in a few studies that regional crime holds the potential to get aggravated by
                        nearby districts whose crime rates are fairly high in comparison. A relationship between the external environment, crimes, and population

                        density is often discussed in macro-perspectives, and ignorance towards micro-
                        perspectives creates space for specific types of crimes. The

                        psychological impact of such metaphoric broken windows creates fear in people's
                        minds. It is important to know what frightens people in public places which could be
                        botheration by disorderly people. Individuals who may be
                        characterized as disreputable, unruly, or capricious encompass those soliciting financial
                        assistance, substance abusers, tumultuous adolescents, individuals participating in
                        loitering, and those experiencing psychological disturbances.<br><br>

                        It's human psychology to avoid any trouble and interference that might lead to future
                        disorganization and clutter. The ignorance towards the broken windows in society raises
                        safety concerns due to negligence on a community basis to overcome this despair in
                        society the concept of community policing is an important step forward as it is based
                        on the broken windows theory of public safety. It is a philosophical advancement
                        designed in such a manner as to leverage citizen engagement and problem-solving as
                        proactive strategies to deal with public safety issues, including crime, disorder, and fear

                        of crime. Police legitimacy can be increased if
                        opportunities are provided to community members to scrutinize the operational conduct
                        and regulatory frameworks of law enforcement agencies, evaluate the congruence of
                        these government-endorsed practices with the values and requirements of the
                        community, and facilitate a reconciliation between the two. The Broken Windows
                        Theory asserts that perceptible indicators of disorder, such as acts of vandalism or the
                        presence of litter, may contribute to an escalation in criminal activity. For instance,
                        concealed dumping sites in Mexico City were determined to be predictive of offenses
                        such as property damage and automobile theft, indicating a correlation between
                        environmental disorder and criminal activity. Moreover, research
                        conducted in Detroit revealed a nonlinear correlation between physical disorder and
                        violent crime, underscoring the necessity of addressing neighbourhoods at a 'tipping
                        point' of disorder (Biasi, 2021). In Mexico, a scholarly investigation has substantiated
                        that the interplay between social and physical disorder significantly impacts homicide
                        rates, thereby affirming the theoretical framework's relevance across diverse cultural
                        contexts. Furthermore, research undertaken in Milwaukee
                        emphasized that disorder within public domains substantially affects crime rates,
                        particularly concerning less severe offenses. However, the

                        effectiveness of the theory may exhibit variability, as illustrated by instances in post-
                        Soviet cities where its implementation faced considerable challenges.

                    <h2>Kharagpur: The Setting of the Case Study:</h2>
                    <p> Kharagpur is an urban area in West Bengal's Paschim Midnapore district. It serves as
                        an important hub for industrial, commercial, and educational operations. Furthermore,
                        it is quickly becoming a popular tourist destination, thanks to the wealth of tourist
                        attractions both within and outside of the city, as well as its well-developed
                        transportation system. The city is home to people of many religious and caste
                        backgrounds, demonstrating a rich ethnic and linguistic diversity. The easy access to
                        basic utility services has increased the attraction of this metropolis and contributed
                        greatly to its growth. The city was originally part of the Hijli Kingdom, ruled by Bengali
                        Hindu rulers.Over time, Kharagpur was governed by notable dynasties, including the
                        Kushan, Gupta, Pal, Mughals, and later the British.The current Kharagpur division
                        shares boundaries similar to the ancient Hijli province.The Kharagpur Railway
                        Junction, established in December 1898, played a pivotal role in the city's growth and
                        recognition. The focus of the discussion here is the Ward-34 of Kharagpur
                        Municipality.
                        <br><br>
                        This ward is home to the Sonmukhi Adivasipara community, many people who have
                        migrated to Kharagpur from neighbouring states of Odisha, Bihar, and Chhattisgarh
                        also live here in this ward making this a culturally varied and rich zone. An un-
                        intentional exclusionary zoning has led to the development of an Adivasi area in Ward 34.
                        <br><br>
                    </p>

                    

                    <h2>Implementation of Broken Windows Policing in Kharagpur:</h2>
                    <p> The secluded and unmaintained streets of the ward create a sense of insecurity and can
                        labelled as the “Broken windows” of this area. The roads lack basic pedestrian
                        accessibility and are unmaintained. People here have delved into a lifestyle that treats
                        this as a normal scenario but for an outsider who would try to navigate a constant fear
                        of botheration by some disorder stays permanently. The streets lack surveillance and
                        exclusionary zoning further creates a segregation and disconnect with others. Zero
                        tolerance policies need to be introduced that impose severe penalties for minor offenses,
                        that reflect principles of Broken Window Theory. Strategies that foster collaborations
                        between law enforcement and community members can help implement community
                        policing. The local stakeholders and the governance authorities need to actively fix the
                        minor problems at the earliest before the points for crime to linger are created in the
                        ward. Local organizations can be used to build social capital. Indulging with schools,
                        businesses, and non-profit organizations to create a support network for community
                        safety initiatives.

                    <h2>Impact on Social Disorder and Public Safety:</h2>
                    <p> The increased cases of public intoxication and substance consumption may disrupt
                        community cohesion. Community engagement and social inclusion initiatives by the
                        government can help sustain social order in the neighborhood.It is important to prevent
                        urban decay before the locality falls into despair leading to increased crimes and social
                        issues. Crime prevention strategies can be introduced by the governing bodies to reduce
                        risk of crimes. Situational crime prevention (SCP) strategies are evidence that
                        theoretically designed prevention strategies are practical and efficient ways to manage
                        the diversity of criminal offending. Clarke (1983) proposed that SCP strategies are
                        characterized as being directed at specific crimes, including manipulations of the
                        environment, and are focused on reducing the opportunities and rewards for crime.

                    <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
                    <p> This theory disproportionately targets the marginalized groups because of the history
                        associated with them. Ethical concerns arise about fairness and justice in law
                        enforcement practices, suggesting that the approach may exacerbate social inequalities
                        rather than resolve them. The hypothesis
                        may give a simplified picture of crime causation, implying that resolving small
                        infractions will result in a decrease in larger crimes. This ignores the intricate
                        interaction of social, economic, and environmental elements that lead to criminal
                        conduct. The theory relies heavily on perceptions of disorder and crime, which can be
                        subjective and influenced by various factors. This reliance on perceptual measures may
                        not accurately reflect actual conditions, leading to potential misinterpretations of the
                        relationship between disorder and crime. Taking
                        lessons from Jane Jacob’s- Eyes on Streets Concept, more interference by
                        the community, more interactions and walkability should be promoted. Both Jacobs and
                        the 'broken windows' theorists share a concern about public fear and its detrimental
                        effects on urban life. Jacobs argues that fear leads to reduced public interaction, which
                        in turn exacerbates urban decline. This aligns with the 'broken windows' assertion that
                        public disorder can lead to increased crime and further deterioration of community
                        safety.

                    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                    <p> The conditions within this ward have the potential for enhancement contingent upon
                        the decisive actions and policy implementations by the governing authorities. On a
                        communal level, endeavours aimed at the revitalization of historical cultures are
                        capable of fostering improved perceptions of safety among residents. While it is
                        feasible to repair broken windows and reconstruct narratives, such advancements can
                        only be achieved through collaborative efforts and collective engagement. Rocke
                        Bosher Adda serves as a pivotal cultural concept within Bengali society, symbolizing
                        informal social spaces designated for casual discourse and communal solidarity. Such
                        actions might be launched to recover forgotten traditions, promoting an inclusive and
                        safe neighbourhood. Aside from this community initiative, the government might
                        encourage local groups to organize events and promote cultural variety. The Local
                        governing bodies also need to be swift in their actions to fix the unmaintained
                        roads, low surveillance streets, and substance abuse problems. A zero-tolerance attitude
                        can change the scenarios of this ward.
