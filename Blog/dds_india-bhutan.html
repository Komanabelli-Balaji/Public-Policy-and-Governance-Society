                </h2>
                <p>Bhutan is often referred to as the “Land of Thunder Dragon.” How does this unique cultural identity shape Bhutan’s approach to diplomacy and international cooperation particularly with its ally, India?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Bhutan came to be known as the Land of the Thunder Dragon after Tshangpa Gyare, a Buddhist master and ancestor of Bhutan’s founding father, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, heard a dragon’s roar from the south, which was a precious omen, symbolic of the Drukpa Kagyu sect of Buddhism is flourishing in the south where the country is presently located. Significantly, the dragon is an important symbol for Bhutan which can also be seen on the national flag. This unique cultural identity of Bhutan and its origins is a testament of the importance Bhutan gives to cultural identity and Buddhism. Bhutan always holds traditional Buddhist values of peace, compassion and non-violence at the heart of its conduct of international relations including relations with India. Bhutan has always promoted peace, sustainability, and human wellbeing at global stages. Bhutan and India have always enjoyed excellent bilateral relations, inclusive of rich cultural diplomacy shaped by historical ties. Guru Rinpoche, revered in Bhutan as the second buddha, was an Indian tantric master who is attributed with introducing Buddhism to Bhutan. India also has many sacred Buddhist sites, one of which is Bodh Gaya, and it also sees significant visits by Bhutanese pilgrims annually. Culture has always been an important part of bilateral relations between the two countries and will continue to remain so. Culture is also an important aspect of the developmental assistance provided by India where funds are often directed to promote efforts of preservation, protection and construction of important Buddhist monasteries and Dzongs.

                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p>India and Bhutan share a deep-rooted bond based on the principle of mutual respect and understanding. Could you highlight some of the most significant milestones in this friendship that have strengthened the ties between our nations?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Bhutan and India enjoy strong bonds of friendship marked by trust, understanding, goodwill and mutually beneficial cooperation. His Majesty Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, the Third King of Bhutan, and India’s first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, were the chief architects who laid strong foundations for Bhutan-India relations. Successive leaders of the two countries have nurtured and further strengthened the special relations over the past many decades, and it is today a model of relations between two neighbors. Some significant milestones of the relationship are: The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed in 1949 between His Majesty the late Third King and late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first Prime Minister, and was revised in 2007. India was the first country with which Bhutan established diplomatic relations in 1968 and has been assisting Bhutan in its planned development since 1961. On 2 February 2018, the two countries commemorated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of formal diplomatic relations. Regular high-level exchanges have been a cornerstone of the bilateral relationship. The relations took a substantive form following visits by His Majesty the late Third King to India in January 1954 and Late Pandit Nehru to Bhutan in September 1958. In 2023 alone, His Majesty The King made two official visits to India in April and November. And this year, the two Prime Ministers of Bhutan and India made their Official and State Visits to India and Bhutan respectively in the month of March which were just a few days apart.

                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p>The increasing significance of e-governance in augmenting efficacy and lucidity in governmental functions has me inquiring about the possible cooperation in this area between the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and Bhutan. Could you kindly elaborate on how IITs may help Bhutan advance its e-governance ambitions, especially with regard to adopting best practices, creating capacity, and implementing technology?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Bhutan has already taken positive strides in achieving the aspirations and goals for e- Governance. And putting more effort to remove the outmoded mindsets and policies which may constraint progressive innovative actions on the ground is critical. It is important to always keep a watchful eye of what other countries are doing and try not to reinvent the wheel, rather leverage the Research and Development (R&D) of other countries, especially our good friend India, which is an emerging global leader. The digitization of economy and e-governance is progressing fast in India and Bhutan could reap the benefits from it. Therefore, IITs in India could play instrumental roles in helping Bhutan emerge as a fully digitized economy and grow its e-governance capability. The support may be in various forms such as sharing R&D, capacity development and tacit knowledge. And also training in cyber security fields. Various methods would benefit Bhutan such as exchange programs, hands-on learning opportunities, designing school/college curriculum for ICT studies, research programs as well as internship opportunities. 
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p>While Bhutan keeps working to improve its education system and incorporate new technologies into its curriculum, we are curious to know if Bhutan and the Indian Institute of Technology (IITs) might work together on this.</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Cooperation between Bhutan and the Indian Institute of Technology (IITs) in enhancing Bhutan’s education system holds immense potential. That is why a delegation led by the Director General of the Ministry of Education and Skills Development, Bhutan visited IIT Kharagpur in 2023. Collaborative efforts could encompass various areas as highlighted such as joint research projects e.g. exploring sustainable technologies, faculty exchange programs to share pedagogical expertise, curriculum development tailored to Bhutan’s needs, and the design of specialized training courses particularly in the field of digital technology. By leveraging the technical prowess and academic rigor of IITs, Bhutan can strengthen its educational infrastructure, equipping its educators and students with the requisite skills to thrive in the digital era. Specifically, areas like renewable energy, environmental conservation, and information technology could benefit from such partnerships, addressing both local challenges and global imperatives. Furthermore, fostering ties with IITs not only enhances Bhutan’s human capital but also strengthens the enduring bonds between India and Bhutan, underpinning the deep-rooted friendship and mutual cooperation between the two nations.
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p>In particular, I want to inquire about the possibility of a partnership between the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur and Bhutan in the field of medical education and information technology. Will you tell me how the MBBS program at IIT Kharagpur will help improve healthcare training and infrastructure in Bhutan? We would like to find out more information on potential partnership areas, such as improving the curriculum, developing programs for faculty, doing cooperative research, and integrating state of the art healthcare technology. How may healthcare service and capacity development in Bhutan be improved by such a partnership between IIT influence of the IIT Collaboration on Bhutan’s Technological Development?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Any collaboration with renowned institutions like IIT Kharagpur would greatly benefit Bhutan not just in medical and information education but also in many other sectors. Bhutan is taking bold steps in improving the overall health care situation in the country despite various challenges.
