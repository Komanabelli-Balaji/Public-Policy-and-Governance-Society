                    <h2>Q. What non-academic activities or hobbies did you engage in during your preparation, and how do you think they contributed to your success?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Rohit Kumar : </h5>
                        You should be clear about what you want to achieve in life. Pursue hobbies related to it. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                         <h5>Himanshu Thapliyal :</h5>
                        I had lots of hobbies. I needed to sacrifice some of them while preparing to improve my concentration toward my goal. Walking was one of my hobbies that i continued. I walked for an hour everyday and revised my notes during my walks.

                    </p>

                    <h2>Q. When did you start preparing?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Himanshu Thapliyal :</h5>
                        I started preparing for GATE in my 4th year. While pursuing MTech, I decided to give ESE. My first attempt was in 2023 but I couldn’t clear the mains. I stayed in Delhi and studied only for ESE in 2024 and obtained 1st rank in the examination.


                   </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Rohit Kumar : </h5>
                        From 2nd year, I started looking for prospects in Civil Engineering field. I came into contact with people who cleared ESE from IIT Kgp. Realising that this is what I wanted to do, I started preparing in my 6th semester. After placements, I worked in a Tata company for 6 to 8 months, after which I resigned and focused on my ESE preparation.  

                    </p>
                    

                    <h2>Q. How did your preparation affect your college life? 
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Rohit Kumar : </h5>
                        I had to sacrifice enjoyment and events like fests to prepare. Even my friends supported me throughout my journey.

                    </p>
                    

                    <h2>Q. What is the right time for a student to start their ESE Journey?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Himanshu Thapliyal :</h5>
                        It is a very long journey. I would suggest you start in your 3rd year. It is important to clear the basics and concepts first. Later on, you should move to work on non- technical aspects of GATE

                   </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Rohit Kumar : </h5>
                        The syllabus is the same as engineering but you need to be clear on the core concepts otherwise you will not be able to analyse structures. It’s a very long race, ensure that you persist throughout it.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Q. Why did you choose ESE over the corporate field?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Rohit Kumar : </h5>
                        Your career depends on your interests. I was not fascinated by Corporate life but found the Civil services field very fascinating.

                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Q. What resources or sources did you use for preparation?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Himanshu Thapliyal :</h5>
                        My college faculty helped me with the basics and concepts. He guided me regarding books I should use to prepare. I was continuously taking guidance from my mentor. Syllabus that is covered in the class is enough. You should work on the applications.

                   </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Rohit Kumar : </h5>
                        In my opinion, the best way to judge your preparation is Previous year Questions. 

                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Q. What was your strategy for the GS exams?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Rohit Kumar : </h5>
                        Out of the 8 subjects, you should pick one that is common to the subjects you have studied as a part of your engineering course. For ethics, using trial and error methods while answering questions helps you score better.
 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                         <h5>Himanshu Thapliyal :</h5>
                         Discussions after covering the syllabus helps you apply your knowledge practically to real-life situations. Newspapers are the best source for current affairs. Personally, before prelims, I focused on interview preparation.

                    </p>
                    <h2>Q. How was your interview experience?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Rohit Kumar : </h5>
                        Since you have reached this point, you have good command of the subject so focus more on practical situations. Focus on mock interviews. The interviewers want to know how you will change the world, not your technical knowledge. Answer honestly, as they can understand if you are lying or unsure of your answer. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                         <h5>Himanshu Thapliyal :</h5>
                         I did 30 mock interviews before the actual interview. However, in my interview, they focused only on the technical part so that could also happen in your interview. You need to be prepared for both.

                    </p>
                    <h2>Q. What do you think interviewers are looking for in a candidate?</h2>
                   
                    <p>
                         <h5>Himanshu Thapliyal :</h5>
                         I would suggest you answer only if you are completely sure, the Interviewers are looking for honest answers that can make an impact. Understand  how to put your point across effectively.


                    </p>
                    <h1>Q. Is it necessary to answer every question asked?</h1>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Himanshu Thapliyal :</h5>
                        No, if you don’t know the answer to something, say so to them. Don’t guess in any circumstance as it shows negatively on you.

                   </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Rohit Kumar : </h5>
                        They are checking how calm and professional you are in a stressful circumstance, not your technical knowledge. You should answer accordingly.


                    </p>
                    
                    <h1>Q. What part of your ESE journey did you like the most?</h1>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Rohit Kumar : </h5>
                        You need to be perfect with your space management and your thought process regarding the question while answering it. I feel as though this fight for perfection is my favourite part of ESE.
 

                    </p>
                    
                    <h1>Q. What was your routine during exam time?</h1>
                    <p>
                         <h5>Himanshu Thapliyal :</h5>
                         During college, I couldn't contribute much time to studies but in my last year of preparation, I was devoting 10-12 hours daily. I would wake up at 3am and revise till 5am. I would meditate from 5 to 6am. I would then practice questions from 6 to 11am. During the time from 11 to 1pm, I would rest to regain my energy. After that, I would study non-technical subjects. I did not waste time on anything else.
                         Closer to the actual exam, I would write mock exams according to the time of the actual exams.
                         

                    </p>
                    <h1>Q. How many PSU interviews have you given after the GATE exam? And how was your experience in them?
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                         <h5>Himanshu Thapliyal :</h5>
                         I gave 4 PSU interviews. I learnt a lot in every interview. Even if you are not selected, you learn a lot regarding the types of questions and how you should act. BIRC was the toughest one because completely technical questions were asked during the interview.
