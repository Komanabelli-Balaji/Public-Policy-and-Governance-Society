                </h2>
                <p>War is the failure of diplomacy. I think this quote best sums up what diplomacy, public policy and international relations is all about. Hello, everyone. Welcome to the inaugural episode of the Diplomatic Discourse Series. I am Agrim Chaudhary, third year undergraduate student at IIT, Kharagpur, and I welcome you all to our brand new initiative. We have with us Mr. Pichaya, who is the official representative of Thailand to India. First of all, thanks a lot, sir, for taking out the time to talk to us. It's a great honour. For the purpose of our viewers, could you kindly introduce yourself?</p>

                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">You're most welcome. Hello, everyone. As introduced, my name is Pichaya. I am the Consul. This is the ranking of diplomatic officers posted here in India. I arrived in Calcutta in June 2022. I've been in Calcutta for one year and a half, 18 months already. And I'm very pleased that IIT Kharagpur has approached the Consulate of Thailand in Calcutta to do this diplomatic discourse, which is very interesting in a way that we, as the professional diplomats, can communicate with you to let you know and have a glimpse of what work we do day by day so that you guys can have a better understanding on the work of diplomacy.

                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);"> My education, I graduated from economics, international economics was my major. And my career is a bit unique. It's not usual because generally, like the Indian Foreign Service examination, people from around the country would come to attend the exam in Bangkok. But that wasn't my path. I got a government scholarship when I was in junior high school at grade nine. I continued my study for eight years in Tokyo, Japan. And as part of the condition of the government scholarship I received, I had to enrol as a diplomatic officer at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thailand. I'm not sure if India has a similar system or not. That's my experience. So I didn't plan from the beginning because when I got the scholarship, I was 15 years old. I just was so happy that I've got to study in japan and stay in an apartment alone without any parents. That was my number one concern. But after my graduation I came back to work in 2008, so I've been working as a diplomat for 16 years already.

                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p>So what started off as a childhood accident, I'm sure has worked out quite well for you, sir. So as you said, you didn't plan a career in diplomacy. When you first entered this world, what was your first reaction like? What did you think about diplomats and people wearing black suits and moving around and all of that? What was your first reaction and your first observation about this field of diplomacy?</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Right. I think I share some of the confusion with the general public because what we perceive as diplomats usually comes from movies, films and entertainment. So, as you mentioned, we see them on screen dressing nicely, having wine, doing something fancy. But personally, I didn't really know what the job of diplomat was. So I struggled. I said I struggled a little bit in my first years because I didn't know what was expected of me. I thought it might be like another typical government job with better English proficiency. But that's not all. As you said, the representation to represent your own country is something unique, something that other government departments don't do. It falls upon diplomats only to be the person to speak on behalf of your government or on behalf of your country. So that's quite a revelation for me. And in short, diplomats connect people from all walks of life. I mean, it's not only politics or economy, but anything that has to do between the people of the two countries or the world, we must be able to converse about it and make sense of it. So the job description is very long. But I can answer your questions for whatever specific topics or experience that you are interested about. 
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p> I think I started off with the quote, “War is the failure of diplomacy.”  and I think in the world that we live in today, with regards to war and potential battles of war that might break out, I feel diplomacy and dialogue has become even more relevant than it previously was. What has been your experience in this regard, interacting with diplomats from other countries, especially India, and what do you think, how has the world changed in the last 15-16 years since you joined service? What has your observation been like, sir?
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);"> I would say that I had high expectations for my job. As you mentioned, I believe that the number one job for diplomats is to rein in the crisis of the world. You have to protect your national security, national interest. And I was very much looking forward to seeing what I can personally do to achieve such goals. But again, in the modern world, I have come to the realisation that the world is so complicated and human society is so complicated. I had to abandon my naive thinking that if one person does this he can achieve something. That is a very simplistic way of thinking. You have to work as a team like a hive mind. But it is very difficult to attribute what part that you achieve in this outcome. But in a way, modern human society is really interconnected. And that's part of me growing to become more mature by understanding that it's not your personal contribution or personal achievement, that is the central question. The central question is how can you affect change? It might be very small, it might be very indirect, but I have to warn myself, don't feel despair. Even if what I do is just 0.01% of the outcome, I still should do it because I have to believe that is for the greater good. That would be my answer to what I experienced for these 15 years. 
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p>Sure. I think diplomacy also brings with it an opportunity to represent your nation abroad which I feel must be a great honour for most people perhaps all. So what has been your experience in that regard representing Thailand currently in India and before this in other countries as well? What has that experience been like, bringing the culture of a nation to all parts of the world?
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Apart from India, I was posted in Jordan. Jordan is in the Middle East. It's neighbouring Iraq and Israel. India is my second country abroad. I would say that the job requirements are very different. In Jordan, normally people speak Arabic. They don't speak English as much as Indians do. So in India, I was able to attend many more events to speak directly with the Indian audience in English. I'm quite impressed that most of the official events here are conducted in English. So that opens an opportunity for foreigners, foreign diplomats like me to be part of such events. That has, in a way, made my job more challenging but also more interesting. I can say only from my own experience within Thai Foreign Service, there is no definite term of reference or the mould to say that this is the way to represent your country. It's more like an art form. We learned the most from great examples of our senior officials. We see how they speak, how they conduct themselves, and above everything, you have to be friendly, you have to be open, you have to trust in the goodness of your counterparts, of the person who you will speak with. You have to believe that by interacting, you can achieve something better. The number one obstacle is mistrust, I would say. As a diplomat, you would have to try to minimise that feeling in order to succeed.
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p> We talked about trust with friendly allies. I think looking at the world order, one can consider India and Thailand have a deep strategic and cultural alliance. I think Thailand has a pretty nice Buddhist influence that has pretty much emanated from India. So in that regard, when you came to India from Thailand, did you see any cultural similarities, any similarities in terms of, maybe not so much in terms of linguistics, but in food, in culture, in behavioural patterns? What was your first reaction like in that regard?
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Of course, I can say that Thailand and India are very close friends. As you mentioned, food, culture, language, many things are similar. I can say that we are part of the same civilization. Buddhism has been spreading out of India into Southeast Asia for more than two million years. That is the foundation of what comes after, like philosophy, the language, the literature, the architecture, anything that has to do with sophisticated systems of humans. I think we inherit a great deal of India's way of thinking and that is still alive and well in the present day. My name is Pichaya. I believe that I can trace its origin back to some of the Sanskrit or Pali words but I'm not an expert on that. In a similar way that English still uses a lot of Latin vocabulary, Thai language uses a lot of Sanskrit and Pali words nowadays. Food, obviously, is one thing that Thailand and India are quite similar in. Curry, spice, coconut milk, these are common ingredients and way of cooking that connect our people together.
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p> I think obviously Thailand is a very beautiful, pristine country and beyond that the archaeological sites dating back to the ancient Buddhist age are there which is perhaps one of the reasons, which I'm sure you must be aware, draws a large number of Indian tourists every single year. Coming to that aspect, what do you think about the confluence of inflow and outflow of tourists to and from India into Thailand? What is the current scenario like in your opinion with regards to the ease of getting visas, flight tickets and all of that? And what can be done, if anything, if you feel like?
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);"> I mean, of course, the spectacular nature and delicious foods have always been the number one attraction for foreign tourists to come to Thailand. But particularly with Indian tourists, there are some historical stories to be told. It's festivals like Holi festival that have kind of transformed into a water festival or Songkran in Thailand, or Loi Krathong, the floating of Pradeep into the rivers to pay respect to the rivers. Thailand has some similarities with some festivals here in India. I think in Odisha, they do the floating of Pradeep into the water as well. I think that these kinds of caveats are quite useful in connecting people with one another. The tourists will feel more meaningful in visiting Thailand. It's not just one delicious food or one nice performing arts and you just go back to India, but you will recognize that this is the heritage of British history. I think that point is quite important in promoting tourism between Thailand and India. Likewise, when Thai people come to India for tourism, number one, they want to follow the footsteps of Lord Buddha, to Bihar, to Bodh Gaya, to Kushana, and 
                    also Nepal, because they want to do the pilgrimage. We are very invested in Buddhist tales that we have been hearing about since we were born, because they are 95% Buddhist countries. But other stories that connect ancient kingdoms together, that's another useful tool to bring more Thai tourists to India. 
                    
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p>As you mentioned there's obviously a great similarity when it comes to culture. So when it comes to the indian and the Thai diaspora, how do you think the people to people ties can be encouraged or promoted by the governments or by the embassies in order to further this collaboration and the confluence of culture </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);"> I think at the moment, Indian and Thai governments have been very supportive of the role of the diasporas in foreign countries and how to promote relations between the two countries. There's a lot of Indian diaspora in Thailand, if I'm not mistaken. I'm not sure, I have to check, but maybe it's about two or three lakh people of Indian diaspora. They come from all over India. My neighbours, my parents' business counterparts, a lot of them are Sikh or Indians. That's very natural. I mean, people get connected by trade and they settle down and they feel that Thailand can be their home because of the openness. I myself am Chinese diaspora. I'm third generation Chinese. I would say that I don't have any single Thai person in my lineage. 
                    But again, with the welcoming arms of Thai society, that made my ancestors decide that this is the country that they want to live in. Government can do so much, but again, they have to be supportive of these foundations. Thai people also marry to other people in foreign countries. And this is our job of the embassies and the consulates to connect with the Thai communities in the countries that they are in. Like in Calcutta, there are dozens of Thai ladies married to local Indians here. We try to bring them in to become a bridge between Thai people and Indian people. We conduct some events like New Year celebration, National Day reception to try to meet them on a regular basis. 
                    
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p> Okay. That's very nice to hear. And I'm sure, you know, collaborations and initiatives like these will only bring the two countries together. Um, So I think we talked about the cultural impact, the cultural similarities that we have, but on a slightly more, you know, sardonic note, the strategic importance I don't think can be overlooked. Like if you look at the Bay of Bengal, I think that serves as a, you know, very vital maritime archway for international trade and all of that. And that is obviously a waterway which is, if you look at it geographically speaking, quite close to both India and Thailand. In recent years, obviously, ensuring the safety of these, earlier days, obviously, as you said, you talk about movies and all, you have seen movies about pirates and all, but nowadays, the different forms of, you know, threats have come together. How do you think the two governments are working together or can work together in order to ensure, you know, the co-safety or the cohabitation of the Bay of Bengal and other, you know, strategically important water bodies and water streams?
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Yeah. The topic you mentioned is very timely and maritime connectivity is very vital to the prosperity of every nation in the globalised world. We cannot live without importing something by sea from our friends abroad. And the Bay of Bengal has always been one of the important trade routes that connecting Asia with this and Europe. 
                    And the threat of piracy that you mentioned It is one thing that I can say that most countries will agree on. There's no much disagreements about the necessity to tackle piracy. So the cooperation in questions in Malacca Strait that connect the Bay of Bengal to South Tennessee, it is one of the most important sea lanes in regards to world trade. and it is very strategic. It used to have piracy problems in the past, but I think because of the cooperation of the countries in the region, that trust has subsided. For now, India and Thailand are both members of the regional cooperation framework that deals with piracy in the Managas Strait. We have to continue cooperation on that. We need to engage with everyone, including our political opponents. 
                    Because if you don't cooperate with your opponents, you will leave the gap that piracy and unwanted negativity would arise. You can see that in Yemen right now because of the spillover effects from the conflict in Gaza with Israel. Now in Yemen, the insurgent groups threatens seaways, at the sea lanes that goes to the Red Sea. So this is not desirable for anyone. So I think we have to be cautious, but optimistically cautious about the cooperation. 
                    
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p> Yeah, you mentioned about the current situation in Yemen. I think that is unfortunate and undesirable for all the parties involved because that is obviously, it brings about a lot of loss in terms of trade and novel, I think, travel as well. So, when we talk about, I think trade there's a free, there are plenty of free trade agreements between India and Thailand, which is obviously, which has increased the volume of trade, as well as the capacity, the net, the net asset that is there considerably over the last four or five years.In this regard, as a key stakeholder, I wanted to know what are your thoughts on balancing open trade and at the same time protecting the interest of the domestically manufactured goods. Balancing that, what is your thoughts as a key stakeholder in this, what do you think, sir?
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);"> It is very vital questions that has been asked all the time. When doing trade liberalizations, in principle, countries would come together to negotiate the rules of the game. And from one time to another, the rules will benefit some segment of the society. And that's that probably what you are mentioning that, yeah, some may lose, some domestic universities may lose as a result of concluding free trade agreements with certain countries. I think, from my personal opinion, we need to have an honest and non-politicized discussion platform so that different interest groups in the countries can come together. Of course, we cannot please everyone, but there have to be a better way that people with different ideas can come together and agree on the direction forward. And that has to be done in tandem with nurturing healthy political culture. Because at the end of the day, the government will call the shot. If the people have more trust towards the government, then the credibility and the support towards any agreement that the government is going to conclude will become more long-lasting and durable. If people don't have trust in what the government is going to do, then whatever agreements, whether it's trade or anything else, it won't last very long. 
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p>Yeah, for sure. Do you think over the last five, six years or something, there has been a greater amount of, you know, greater number of doors that have been opened for foreign trade, foreign investment, and a bit of an ease down in terms of the regulations and, you know, taxation laws that have been there. Do you think it has become a bit easier, especially with regards to India?
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">  With regards to India, as far as I know about, Thailand has one free trade agreement, bilateral one with India. And another multilateral one is ASEAN-India free trade agreement. I say this because normally, trade negotiations falls under issue of Trade Administrative Congress. So as a foreign service, you have to know about it. But we are not the one who have the direct control about it. So I would say that with regards to India, I think every country is including in that it will take time. Society and industry change rapidly. Whatever attitudes people or countries as a whole had, five or ten years ago may not hold true today. So when collectively one country come to realization that it's the better way forward to lower the barriers with regards to trade, I think naturally that countries will go towards the direction of liberalisation. 
                    But as you see many backlash in recent years that people talking about anti-globalization. Globalisation is dead. I think it's not dead, but governments and people have to be more mindful of the impact, whether it's positive or negative from trade liberalisation. And so that all groups in the society can tolerate change in a way that they feel justified and inclusive.                     
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p>Sir , you mentioned about multilateral trade agreement and obviously uh thailand is a member country of the asian association of southeast asian nations and India, though not a member country, I think has been an important observer in that uh so but i understand my voice is not as melodious, so this will make it will make the interview very boring. If I just go on, so i'd like my friend Prathvi to take over in that regard uh sir talking about tourism, so what do you think that like increasing tourism will also increase the people-to-people connection between our countries. And sometimes people-to-people connection play a great role in diplomacy, right? So apart from visa on arrivals, what else can the two countries do to increase people-to-people connection and in general tourism in our countries?
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);"> Right. Tourism is a big topic for Thailand and India. I think before COVID-19 pandemic, there's almost 20 lakhs to millions Indian tourists visiting Thailand every year. But on the other hand, Thai tourists is a bit lower. I mean, only two or three lakhs coming because we are much smaller population comparing to India. Right now, first time ever, the Thai government decided to lift the requirement for visa for Indian tourists on a temporary basis from December last year to May 10, 2024. 
                    We hope that this new scheme will help make it easier for Indian people to travel to Thailand. I think more and more countries are looking to get away with the visa requirements to make it more comfortable for people to travel from one country to another. But I get asked a lot whether ASEAN to South Asia would go the same direction as Europe. whether to adopt Schengen visa, something like that. I think it's still far away. I mean, we are not like Europe in a way that we want to achieve political unity. So I think to ease the burden of the visas requirements, I think it's a noticeable trend that many countries will follow in the coming years.
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p>Sir , environmental concerns are a major topic in today's world. 
                    The world is looking towards net zero carbon emission and green energy. The world is looking forward for United Nations sustainable development goal. So it is our responsibility to educate people about the environmental changes that are happening and, you know, going green. So how is Thailand looking forward to it? Is Thailand doing something to integrate things about climate change in their education system? 
                    </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);"> Right. I think what young people are being educated today is quite different from what I attended at school, I think 20-25 years ago. And climate change, I would say that it is number one challenge for our future. And recently, the Thai government has created a new government department. We call the Department of Climate Change and Environment. So this reflects our urgent concern 
                    that we have to redouble our efforts to rectify the problem of climate change and carbon emissions. And in general, I would say that the Thai government policy towards climate change, it rests upon the adoption of electric vehicles. I don't know. is applicable to anyone or not. We used to call ourselves Detroit of EVs because we produced so much pickup trucks and vehicles. So we want to turn our fossil fuel based vehicles production into the EVs. So that's the strategy that the government is trying to achieve. The adoption rate of EV in Thailand right now is about 8.7%. So it has roughly double from the year before. So I think similar to India, governments are trying to persuade people to change their lifestyle to become more environmentally friendly. 
                    And another area is to try to do more sustainable agriculture because agricultural products are one thing that Thailand is proud of. Obviously, Thai food products are the thing that make Thailand known to the foreign countries. So the governments are giving a lot of innovative schemes and subsidies so the farmers can convert the byproducts and agricultural waste into something useful like biofuel or bioplastics. The best two things that I can be certain is the EV and sustainable agriculture. 
                    
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p> So just following up on that, obviously a lot of countries are trying to do a lot of things with regards to climate change on a very individual basis, but what is, what do you think with regards to eventually obtaining a goal that is common, that is, that falls under a common umbrella? With regards to that, what do you think about the nation-to-nation collaboration obviously there are things you want to do on a, on an internal basis, but do you think there is something that is being done or that can be done between any country, any two countries in general and between India and Thailand in particular, in order to foster this talk and you know, the goals towards climate change and net sustainability.

                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);"> Right I agree with you that you mentioned that what I a pair of two countries can do together. At the background, we can see that the global negotiation for climate change has stalled. It doesn't progress as fast as we wish it to be. And so we have to do two problems. At a global level, we still continue to negotiate our emission targets. Whenever a country aims to achieve net zero, they can just announce so. But between the two countries, Thailand and India, we have to share experience and expertise to one another. India is an upcoming country with regards to renewable energy and solar power. India is the proponent of the International Solar Alliance, which is a framework to promote solar power adoption worldwide. Thailand is looking forward to engage with India more in this framework. It is a member already. And Thailand is also investing in India's renewable energy. And there's an Indian company named Avada Energy, which operates several solar power plants across India, including Eberhard. And Thailand is becoming a major stakeholder in this company. So I think is the way forward that our countries can work together.

                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p> Sir , technology is something that could be used to not only increase awareness about sustainable development, but also we can take and use modern technologies like artificial intelligence to head towards a more sustainable future. So what do you think that how the two countries can collaborate in the aspect of artificial intelligence to, you know, head towards a more sustainable future and spread more awareness about issues like climate change? 
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">That's quite an advanced question. But from my personal view, artificial intelligence is a very promising area. But you need a very large data set so that your model of prediction becomes more and more reliable. And on that part, I think because India has a very large population. A lot of data points can be taken from to develop the model for the algorithms. And that's why everyone looks up to India as the next leader of the AI development. And that experience, that expertise will be very useful for smaller countries, including Thailand. If India can come up with some kind of global initiative in utilising AI for the greater good, for the sustainability. I think that will elevate India diplomacy to a high level.

                <p>Education has a huge role to play in one's life. How can Thailand and India collaborate in the educational aspect? Can universities from the two countries become partners or move ahead with increasing collaborative educational research funding for different projects?
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);"> I think the Indian government is doing a great job of promoting awareness among Thai students and scholars. Several Indian studies at Indian book corners in Thai University are established by the Embassy of India in Bangkok. A partnership between universities would help bring younger students closer to one another. But it's not only about the structure but the storytelling. Of course, you can have a cooperation framework between the governments and the universities, but you have to develop a story of how to sell to the students. Why is this story interesting to learn about Indochina cultural relations or historical ties between our two countries? Everything needs a market. It applies the same to education and cooperation. It has to be relevant to modern audiences. I don't like what I have been taught at school about India because it sounded outdated and really stuffy. It offers me nothing valuable for my life that I'm using social media and connecting with people on the platforms. So it entices young people to think that it is still relevant to their modern way of living. It's less old than 2000 years old, but you have to find some way to convince people that if it is 2000 years old, it still matters today, and it is fun; it will make you popular on social media somehow. But we have to come up with ideas to solve the education issue.
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p> As you mentioned about education, the curriculum in general, at least in India, I can speak, needs to be revamped slightly more to include the current world order we live in and make it somewhat more enjoyable for the students. As you mentioned at the beginning, this is the second country you've posted in. So, could you tell me about your experience living in India? How would you describe the people, their behaviour, nature, attitude, food, climate, and overall experience?
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">:I would say that Indians are much more superior in communication than Thai people. It probably has to do with upbringing, attitude, and linguistic capability. But all in all, even if an Indian can't converse in English, I feel the energy from them to talk to one another, to try to make themself understood by the foreigners; this is the quality that I noticed vividly because it's the difference that Thai people can be told that they are more reserved. They don't talk much. And the reason is that They don't know you. But Indian people, you guys always make yourself known out loud in the open. That's a good thing. That makes Indians great communicators, making them become CEOs of global companies because you guys are so great at talking and conveying ideas. I think Indian people are quite philosophical. It's the birthplace of many symbolic names associated with philosophy. I can feel that you guys can get quite nerdy, and When discussing something that is not at a supranational level but something that has a deep meaning, that is something that Indians are pretty good at. Besides that, India is a country of great diversity, where inequality exists. The wealthiest person and the poorest person are so vastly different. Well inequality exists in every country, but it shows itself in the most extreme way in India. It's not good or bad in itself, but that's the fact that foreigners would come and be amazed about it.
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p> Yeah, that's a candid observation from your side, sir. As you mentioned, philosophy and spirituality, and obviously, the fact that so many major religions have stemmed or rooted themselves from this very homeland, lends us a specific blend of spirituality to almost everyone born here or even everyone who comes here. Are you currently in Kolkata, as you mentioned earlier? Have you had the chance to visit other parts of India, such as different cities or towns?
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);"> Yes. My nature, my work, I have to travel because our consulate is in Kolkata; we are responsible for five states and one territory in India. It's West Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andaman and Nicobar. So... I got to travel a lot, particularly in Bodh Gaya. Thai Buddhist pilgrims visit Bodh Gaya a lot. It's about 80,000 people before 2019. Every year, Thai people would come to Bodh Gaya along with Bhubaneswar, Chennai, Darjeeling, and Port Blair with regards to travel
                    A large number of Indian tourists who flock to Thailand every single year; all of us know about Bangkok and some of the other islands there, but is there any uncharted territory or maybe underrated places in Thailand that you'd recommend not just to Indians but to general anyone to visit you know that is not so much broadcasted but are beauties in themselves . For Indian tourists, I would say that they know a lot about Bangkok, Pattaya, and Phuket. Chiang Mai in the northern part has become more and more popular. However, the northeast of Thailand, which borders Laos and Cambodia, is another region that might be interesting. It's a totally different culture. It has a lot of influence from Khmer culture, like Angkor Wat; that kind of stone is Hindu influence from the Chola dynasty. There are temples and palace ruins with stories connected to ancient India. I think that's another vision that can be upcoming for Indian tourists.                     
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p> You mentioned that you find a lot of differences between what you read or heard about India and what India you live in right now. Can you compare the differences you anticipated about India based on what you've read or heard with your actual experiences now that you're living here?
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);"> There are stereotypes that Thai people, including myself, have towards Indian people. But when I come to live in India and interact with actual Indian people, I would say that it's not all true. Not all people are cunning or trying to be honest about you. But Indian people are like Thai people and have a lot of good people. There are always some bad people, But the way of thinking or the way that people expect transparency or honesty from one another, I think that's the thing that you have to meet a person from that country and know to gauge that expectation and to learn by heart, and this is the thinking of the Indian people.  This is what he or she expects from me. And I think it's a lot easier when you've got some understanding of that.                 
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p> To recap this conversation, we discussed ASEAN and the almost-held annual summit. India is not a member country but is in the observer category for nearly all summits. What do you think with regard to the G20 summit?  In some ways, a lot of people believe that has transformed the world from being firstly bipolar to unipolar to now it's like a multipolar or multilateral world. In that column, what do you perceive about the importance of organisations like the ASEAN in ensuring that the hegemony of a particular nation or alliance does not overrule or override the entire world order? 
                </p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h2 style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);">Interviewee:</h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);"> That's a very huge question. And, yes, we have seen a lot of rapid changes in our geopolitical landscape in recent years. It was said that the 21st century will be the Asian century. So, that still holds true. The demographic advantages still favour Asian continents over other developed nations and regions worldwide. Personally, I cannot say that the multipolar world is going to be better than the bipolar or unipolar world. You have everything in the family. A unipolar world can be close to a family that has a very strong-minded mother. What she says is what's to be done. Nobody argues with her. You can tell that that family has stability, but maybe there's some resentment, and they will end up. So, the world is analogous to the family. You cannot say that this type of arrangement is going to work. You have to have a lot of communication, and many grievances and voices need to be heard. And trust needs to be built. And as you mentioned, India is a part of the G20 and many other frameworks. Additionally, India is also part of a British country. All that is positive because it creates more bridges and more connections, even with your political opponents, as I mentioned. So we have to keep the communication going, never stop talking to one another, and try to come up with a mutual agreement. Including the rules of the game. And how can I appeal if I'm not happy with those rules? How can I make changes in a way that is acceptable to everyone? That's a challenge ahead of time, and every country needs to find a way.                 
                </p>
                <h2>Interviewer:
                </h2>
                <p> Yeah, you mentioned this possibly being the century of the Asians. And it's high time that the Global South finally punched above its weight, and it's known for its capability. That's a lovely note to cap up this conversation. First of all, again, as I mentioned at the beginning, thanks a lot, sir, for taking the time. Given your commitments, we understand that taking out precious one-hour and one-and-a-half hours to talk with us was an unbelievable experience for us. And I'm sure everyone watching this video will be greatly enlightened by your thoughts, views, and whatever we discussed. And it will go a long way in educating people about the literacy of the world in which we live.

                <p style="color: rgb(6, 6, 110);"> You're most welcome, and uh thank you again for uh letting me be part of this uh discourse uh and I'm not expert in any single topic that you raised about today, but this is to show to you that being a diplomat, being the bridge between countries, you have to be able to make sense of many things that you don't know a lot about. Still, it falls upon your job to convey the correct message and create positive outcomes. 
                    So I hope this is what diplomatic real life looks like. I would be happy to share my thoughts and experiences in another edition. And I look forward to the Thai Consulate working with IIT Kharagpur.

                <p>It would be our privilege to collaborate with you again. So, to sum it up, friends, we live in a world where we are constantly weighed down by the thoughts of incarceration and war yet uplifted by the hope for a better world ahead. This conversation was about the diplomacy between countries and the world order in which we live and hope to live. Thanks a lot for joining in. This was the first edition of the Diplomatic Discourse series, and we hope to be back talking to more seasoned diplomats and more representatives in India about our country, our world, and a joint global family. Thanks a lot. Let's wrap up for one second.
