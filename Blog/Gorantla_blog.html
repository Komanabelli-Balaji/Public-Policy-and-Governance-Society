                            Without community service, we would not have a stronger quality of life, and it’s important to the person who serves as well as the recipient. It’s how we grow and develop. Presenting our UPSC dynamo-Gate whiz, today’s guest speaker and our alumnus, Mr.Gorantla Sai Charan, graduate from IIT Kharagpur 2021 in the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, who cracked All India rank 1 in UPSC ESE 2023 and All India Rank 19 in UPSC ESE 2022 and with Ranks 115 and 114 in Gate examination 2021 and 2022 respectively.

                            The need of the hour is to show concrete and collective resolve to ensure peace, harmony and security in the world. I am confident that next year when the G20 meets in the holy land of Buddha and Gandhi, we will all agree to convey a strong message of peace to the world.

                    <h2>Q. Could you share one unexpected aspect about yourself, beyond academic achievements, that adds a personal touch to your journey?
                    </h2>
                    <p>Academic excellence is essential, but my family and friends played a crucial role in my journey, and they were all happy with my results.



                    </p>

                    <h2>Q. How did your time at IIT Kharagpur shape your approach to UPSC preparation?
                    </h2>
                    <p>Apart from the academics I got from IIT Kharagpur, the culture and diversity helped me on the journey ahead of graduation.</p>

                    <h2>Q. Securing AIR-1 is a remarkable achievement.
                        What are your aspirations for the future, both professionally following this success in UPSC ESE?
                        
                    </h2>
                    <p>After this, I want to take the civil services examination preparation, but am also satisfied with what I have achieved till now. I want to be in touch with people and help society. Every sector provides service to the nation, but the government sector provides a platform where we can serve society directly.</p>

                    <h2>Q. Can you share your overall approach to studying for UPSC ESE? How did you structure your preparation routine?</h2>
                    <p>Most of the concepts or subjects that are covered in my engineering helped in my ESE preparation the syllabus is different for UPSC engineering services examinationESE  portion that is covered in KGP.it acted as headstart for me in my preparation and did not take much time for the remaining amount. Coming to routine, it took roughly 5 to 6 hours during preparation and 3 to 4 hours during revision. I made sure that my routine was not stressful.</h2>
                    <h2>Q. How did you prioritize subjects during your preparation? Were there specific subjects you focussed on more intensively?</h2>
                    <p>Everybody will have some strengths and weaknesses. First of all, one has to focus on that. Coming to me, I had to focus on those subjects that were not covered in my B-tech and that were not self-sufficient.</p>
                    <h2>Q. Can you tell us the sources and resources for the preparation? Is this enough to properly study from our engineering professors to crack this exam?</h2>
                    <p>A proper study of our engineering syllabus by our professor is necessary but insufficient. Nearly 75-80% syllabus in B-tech is included in ESE, so that acted as the backbone for me.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Q. How did you address and improve your weakness in specific subjects or topics?</h2>
                    <p>For me also there are some subjects, if any question comes from them, I  frightened, but it is important to notice those subjects and work on them for oneself. Coming to my weakness I  my fundamentals, took notes and listened to various classes on them.</p>
                    <h2>Q. Can you share specific hurdles faced during UPSC ESE preparation and the strategies that helped you overcome them?</h2>
                    <p>The hurdle I faced was a lack of time because I didn't even decide on ESE until my final year. So, I need to manage time for academics and preparation. so time management was crucial.</p>


                    <h2>Q. Given your previous success in UPSC ESE, why would you retake the exam and what motivates you?</h2>
                    <p>With  result, I joined the central electrical authority  an electronics and communication engineer. I could not find more scope in this job since it inclined more toward electrical engineering. My first priority was the telecommunications department, where I could use my skills more efficiently.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Q. What motivates you to pursue engineering, specifically to enter the public sector?</h2>
                    <p>I was a logical thinker. I have a mind for engineering. Later on, I intended to get in touch with people and wanted to see what could be done directly to people, and wanted to average my technical skills.</p>

                    <h2>Q. Is there a need to go beyond semester materials while preparing for UPSC ESE?</h2>
                    <p>Semester materials are covered, but not all of the syllabus is covered; there is a need to go beyond..</p>
